# GuacamoleSharp

GuacamoleSharp is a bare-bones C# replacement of the Apache Guacamole server-side Java servlet.
It is intended for customizable integration of Apache Guacamole into existing frontend projects with their own user and connection management.

Like the official Java Guacamole-Client, GuacamoleSharp makes use of the Guacamole-Protocol and is intended to be used with 'Guacamole-Common-Js' (frontend client) and 'Guacd' (server-side proxy) by Apache. Check out the [Apache Guacamole Docs](https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/) for more detailed information.

Inspired by Vadim Pronin's [guacamole-lite](https://github.com/vadimpronin/guacamole-lite).
